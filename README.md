## **Project Description / Outline**
Data were obtained in a survey of students' Maths and Portuguese Language courses in Secondary School. The purpose of the project is to use data analytic tools to reveal the relationship between students' family socio-economic status, students' study behaviour, students’ alcohol consumption and students’ grades.

### **Research Questions**
Basic Data Summary - analysis by gender/age/behaviour/socio-economic status
1. The data set has fairly equal gender distribution. 
2. Based on this dataset, Males performed better in Math while females performed better in Portuguese.
3. Age proportion on alcohol consumption

Student Behaviour Analysis---
How does students’ alcohol consumption impact a student's grade? -
  As it is shown in the pie charts, during the weekdays, nearly 70 % of the students consumed quite a small amount of alcohol, on the contrary, the percentage of students who drank very little on the weekend was around 38%.
 Based on our data set , we can see that weekday alcohol consumption is way less hence scoring a higher percentage as per, which therefore implies students drink less over weekdays and thus have a higher chance to study and make better grades. As can be seen in their G3 math and G3 Portuguese
Unlike weekends, students tend to drink more, and thus have less time in studies, but it would appear the more social interaction, their Portuguese grades are higher. But there is a complete opposite with their Math grades, the more alcohol they drink , the less time they have to study hence affecting their Math grades.
