**Project Members:** Joshua Tean | Wilfred Andoh | Yan Shao | Haodong Zhang \
**Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption


## **Project Description / Outline**
Data were obtained in a survey of students' Maths and Portuguese Language courses in Secondary School. The purpose of the project is to use data analytic tools to reveal the relationship between students' family socio-economic status, students' study behaviour, students’ alcohol consumption and students’ grades.

### **Research Questions**
Basic Data Summary - analysis by gender/age/behaviour/socio-economic status
1. The data set has fairly equal gender distribution. 
2. Based on this dataset, Males performed better in Math while females performed better in Portuguese.
3. Age proportion on alcohol consumption

Student Behaviour Analysis---
How does students’ alcohol consumption impact a student's grade? -
  As it is shown in the pie charts, during the weekdays, nearly 70 % of the students consumed quite a small amount of alcohol, on the contrary, the percentage of students who drank very little on the weekend was around 38%.
  Based on our data set , we can see that weekday alcohol consumption is way less hence scoring a higher percentage as per, which therefore implies students drink less over weekdays and thus have a higher chance to study and make better grades. As can be seen in their G3 math and G3 Portuguese
  Unlike weekends, students tend to drink more, and thus have less time in studies, but it would appear the more social interaction, their Portuguese grades are higher. But there is a complete opposite with their Math grades, the more alcohol they drink , the less time they have to study hence affecting their Math grades.

How does students' study behaviour impact a student's grade?-
  Based on our analysis, the most significant impact is students' study time which have a general impact on students' grade. Other factors like extra educational support, family support, paid classed and extra-curricular activites only have specific impact on either Math or Portuguese final grade. For class absenteeism impact, we can see that the the abense affects the Portuguese more than Math.
  
Socio-Economic Factors Analysis---
How does students' family socio-economic status impact a student's grade?-
  Based on Travel Time and living area analysis, 73% students who live in Urban areas spend less than 15 mins to school while those who live in Rural Areas spend more time in traveling. From box plot we can see relationship between the travel time and final grades. Those who spend less time in travelling seems have general better academic grade. Assumption would be travel time has positive impact on students grade if you spend less travel time to school.
  For Portugese students, family relationship can help to get better final grade while Math grade is not affected.
  
Summary and Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis: Study time has impact on Final Grade. - T test reject the hypothesis for Math and is true for Portugese
Null Hypothesis: Alcohol consumption have impact on Final Grade. - T test reject the hypothesis for Math and is true for Portugese
